# thingiverseio

ThingiverseIO is a library to connect individual programs across local networks. It provides tools to build custom peer-to-peer networks, which are reliable, fault-tolerant and easy to use. Use cases are custom home automation and scientific labratories.

** Introduction

ThingiverseIO allows you to create custom network of 'Things', which are just programs which import and/or export functionality, properties, streams and observables. These 'Things' declare their in-/output functionality in a manifest, called descriptor. Inputs find appropriate outputs with a peer-to-peer strategy. 

An Input manifest can fe fullfilled by multiple outputs. There are multiple strategies for user to make use of this.
